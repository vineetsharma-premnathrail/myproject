# =========================================
# Python Dependencies for Premnath Engineering Calculator SaaS
# =========================================
# Comprehensive package manifest for the Engineering SaaS Platform.
#
# Purpose: Defines all Python package dependencies required for the application
# to function properly. Includes web framework, data processing, database connectivity,
# security, PDF generation, and supporting libraries for the engineering platform.
#
# Installation: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Development: pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
# Production: Use pinned versions for reproducible deployments
#
# Architecture Overview:
# - FastAPI ecosystem for modern web API development
# - Scientific computing stack for engineering calculations
# - Database connectivity with ORM abstraction
# - Security and authentication components
# - Document generation and file processing capabilities
#
# Package Categories:
# - Web Framework: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Gunicorn for API serving
# - Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas for numerical computations
# - Visualization: Matplotlib for charts and engineering plots
# - Document Generation: ReportLab, python-docx for reports
# - Database: SQLAlchemy, psycopg2 for PostgreSQL connectivity
# - Security: PassLib, bcrypt for password hashing
# - Email: email-validator for user communication validation
# - Configuration: Pydantic-settings for environment management
#
# Version Pinning Strategy:
# - Major versions pinned for API stability
# - Minor versions allowed to float for security updates
# - Critical security packages (bcrypt) fully pinned
# - Development tools unpinned for latest features
#
# Security Considerations:
# - Use trusted package sources (PyPI)
# - Regularly audit for vulnerabilities
# - Keep dependencies updated for security patches
# - Use virtual environments for isolation
#
# Performance Notes:
# - NumPy/Pandas for efficient numerical operations
# - SQLAlchemy connection pooling for database efficiency
# - Gunicorn for production WSGI serving
# - Uvicorn for ASGI async capabilities
