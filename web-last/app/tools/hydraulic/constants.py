"""
Hydraulic Tool Constants Module
==============================
Purpose:
    Defines physical constants used in hydraulic calculations.
    Provides standardized values for engineering calculations.
Layer:
    Backend / Tools / Hydraulic / Constants
Physical Constants:
    - GRAVITY: Standard gravity acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
Usage:
    - Resistance force calculations
    - Power and torque conversions
    - Vehicle dynamics modeling
Standards:
    - Based on standard gravity at sea level
    - Consistent with braking tool constants
    - SI units throughout calculations
